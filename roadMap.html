							<p>This project was created to help a Project Management Team of an organization, where the team has all the 
								resources like the tasks, start dates, end dates, predecessor, successor, as well as the chronology, which 
								is also regraded as vertical levels or positions. The goal was to generate a roadmap of the project planning 
								on Google Slides with the aid of the available formatted resources in Google Sheets. Following that, the script 
								was expected to be available to all the team members with the expectation that some members might not be able to 
								deal with the raw codes on Visual Studio or another IDE, so I had to append it as a Google Sheet Extension only 
								for the members of the team.</p>

							<h2>How it works</h2>
							<p>All the team members logging in with the organization's Google domain are automatically verified to access the 
								"RoadMap Generator" extension in their Google Sheets. Once they download it as an add-on and run the extension, 
								the user is required to give some inputs like the Pre-made template name, Source Sheet Name, Scales, and 
								Cartesian Start Position of the road map. Following the inputs, the AppScript Code reads the source files and 
								calculates the rectangular object of Google Slide for the tasks with the aid of Scales and Start Position. 
								Lastly, with the aid of the Google Drive, Sheets, and Slides API, AppScript generates the RoadMap presentation 
								in the team member's Google Slide in a ready to Present Slide that comes well labelled and have the minor 
								details.</p>
							<h2>Tools Implemented or Playing a Key Role</h2>
							<p>
								1. Google Drive API: This is utilized to access the existing "template" slides that provide the foundation for 
								creating the roadmap. The API also allows the creation of a copy of the slide presentation.<br />
								2. Google Sheets API: Employed to read the source data sheets, extract the required data, and format it into 
								another sheet.<br />
								3. Google Slides API: This API is used to create the roadmap on a copy of the "template" slide stored in Google 
								Drive.<br />
								4. Google OAuth: Integrated to provide verification upon the installation of the Add-on. As it was developed 
								with a focus solely on the organization, external access is restricted. It also obtains permission from users 
								to read and write in their Google Drive.<br />
								5. Google Marketplace: Utilized to publish and promote the script as an extension, available as an add-on for 
								Google Sheets used by the organization's employees.</p>
							<h2>Steps to setup the environment for Add-on </h2>
							<p>
								1. Make sure that the template slide for the base layer of the roadmap exists (a sample of template slides is 
								provided in the repository).<br />
								2. The source sheet should adhere to the standard structure of a spreadsheet, with the following guidelines: 
								a. Row 1 serves as the header, and all subsequent rows contain data. b. Column headers include Activity ID, 
								Task Name*, Start Date*, Finish Date*, Successor, Predecessor, and . These headers begin from column 1 in 
								sequential order. Column headers marked with an asterisk are crucial for the program to generate taskbars on 
								the roadmap. They must remain in their designated positions (Task Name*, Start Date*, Finish Date*, and Vertical
								 Position/Level* in columns B, C, D, and E respectively). Other columns can be rearranged as needed.<br />

										<img src="images/rms1.jpeg" alt="" width="1000"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								3. Each cell/row should be filled with the user's chosen color for the task bar. The program reads the 
								background color of individual row cells when reading the roadmap data and uses it to color the generated 
								taskbars.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rms2.jpg" alt="" width="700"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								4. Dates should follow one of these formats: either as a date object, like “July 1, 2027 8:00 AM” or 
								“26-Sep-22”, or as a string, like “16-Jul-21 A”, where the initial part of the string contains the date to be 
								used.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rms3.jpeg" alt="" width="700"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								5. As the template of the Google Slide used for generating the roadmap slide may vary, there is no pre-generated
								 template. Hence, ensure that you create an appropriate template before running the program.<br />
								6. The template should be designed using the “insert table” feature. Add columns and rows according to the 
								specific requirements of the roadmap. Make sure that the table is not placed in the theme/layout layer of the 
								slide, as this information is not duplicated when the slide is copied.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rms4.jpeg" alt="" width="700"height="400"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								7. Each Google presentation should comprise only one slide. The designated template slide for drawing should be 
								the sole slide in the template.<br />
								8. The height of the grid on which the roadmap task bars will be drawn should be a minimum of 12.25 cm.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rms5.jpeg" alt="" width="900"height="400"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								9.Verify that the language setting for your slide is English (Canada) to ensure that the measurements used are 
								in the metric system. If they appear in imperial format, confirm that the language is set to Canada and not the 
								US.

							<h2>Steps to use the Add-on </h2>
							<p>
								1. Install the 'RoadMap Automation Extension' as an add-on in your Google Sheets.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu1.jpeg" alt="" width="700"height="400"/>
										<img src="images/rmu2.jpeg" alt="" width="700"height="400"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								2. Once this is completed, you'll notice a new feature added under 'Extensions' called 'Draw Task Bars and 
								Milestones.'<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu3.jpeg" alt="" width="700"height="400"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								3. To utilize this feature, begin by entering the name of the source sheet in your Google Spreadsheet.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu4.jpeg" alt="" width="400">
									</span>	
								</center>
								<br />
								4. Following that, the system will prompt you to specify the name of the Google Slide template you intend 
								to use for your roadmap.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu5.jpeg" alt="" width="400"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								5. Subsequently, you will be required to input the length of the taskbar for a month. You can determine 
								this length by utilizing the  'Insert Shape' function and adjusting its format. Add a rectangular shape to 
								the grid and calculate the monthly length of the taskbar using the 'Size & Rotation' options.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu6.jpeg" alt="" width="400"height="300"/>
										<img src="images/rmu7.jpeg" alt="" width="900"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								6. Moving on, input the X-Coordinate from which you want the roadmap's taskbar to commence, employing the 
								'Position' feature.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu8.jpeg" alt="" width="400"/>
										<img src="images/rmu9.jpeg" alt="" width="900"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								7. Lastly, provide the Y-Coordinates indicating the starting point of the roadmap's taskbar, also using the 
								'Position' feature.<br />
								<center>
									<span class="image">
										<img src="images/rmu10.jpeg" alt="" width="400"/>
										<img src="images/rmu11.jpeg" alt="" width="900"/>
									</span>
								</center>
								<br />
								That should generate a Google slide with the Roadmap.
